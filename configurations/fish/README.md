# Fish Shell (configurations/fish)

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is the friendly interactive shell.

## Configuration Path
- macOS: `~/.config/fish`
- Linux: `~/.config/fish`

## Local Specific Configuration
Local configs to not version control are placed within a `./config/local` directory. This directory is ignored within the `./.gitignore` file.
The files will then be sourced within the main `./config/config.fish` configuration script.
